1. Apparently we might need a seperate state for doing approvals
#[account]
#[derive(InitSpace)]
pub struct Approval {
    pub bank_owner: Pubkey,          // Owner of the bank being approved
    pub delegate: Pubkey,            // Who can spend the tokens
    pub approved_amount: u64,        // How much can be spent
    pub remaining_amount: u64,       // How much is left to spend
    pub created_at: i64,             // When approval was granted
    pub expires_at: Option<i64>,     // Optional expiration
}
